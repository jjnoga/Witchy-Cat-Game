Hey Anita! Whatcha up to?
Weren't you busy with a potion tonight?

Oh no! You ran out of your special ingredients? 
That's no good.

If you need any help, let me know and I'll aid you
however I can.
I swear it! On my name, Blorbo the owl!

Hi again Anita, do you need help?

those ingredients.
Back again Anita? What can I help you with?
