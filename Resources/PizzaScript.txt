BEST FRIEND IS A PIZZA SLICE!!!!
*ans\ntest
Aw man, I thought that one was gonna be perfect
cause my name is pizza and you're a home slice...
YOOOOOOO!!! ITS ANITA THE BESTIE
\ntest
What are you doing all the way out here? Most of the 
time you don't randomly show up out of the sand.
...
\ntest
Damn, I even reminded you to check your ingredient
stock before today. 
You don't got much time Pizza Slice, you gotta motor.
\ntest
The nickname? Oh yeah, I have been work shopping it.
You need a bestie nickname that is funny but fits.
I'm still working on it, but do you like it? 
\ntest
Anyway, I'm not sure where, but the ingredient you
need is in that maze. I'm still trying to figure out
why the maze showed up or how it changes everyday.
\ntest
Maybe it is the lizards lololol, I am sure you saw
how many there are out and about.
\ntest
Today there seems to be rocks in the maze, those are
new. Welp I guess I can help you out with that. 
\ntest
I know you're too small to push those big rocks out 
of the way, so I'll give you a little something.
...
\ntest
No no, not my "special" ingredients. Those, while fun, 
will only distract you.
\ntest
I was saving this, but I suppose I owe you one after 
you took the fall for me having "special" ingredients.
\ntest
Here you go, the Staff of Moving! It'll help you with
those rocks. Press i to check what you have with you.
\ntest
Good luck! Tell the Lizards I said Hi! Remember that
pressing e sends stuff back to your house!

*ans\ntest flag
Remember, press i to see what you have and press e 
to send it back to your house to grab something else.
*ans\ntest
Okay! Get going then and then press e to send it to 
your house when you are done. I'll get it back later.
