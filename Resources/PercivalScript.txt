Oh, Anita, your timing is impeccable!
\ntest
Pray tell you could not forget me? After all,
I am Percival the Great!
\ntest
...Well, not 'the Great' just yet, I'm still working
on that.
\ntest
*ehem* Anyways, I fear my insatiable appetite has
once again arisen from its slumber.
\ntest
Why, by Jove, this pain in my gut has me rendered
immobile!
\ntest
Anita, could you be a doll and fetch me some fish?
Preferably one that has sufficiently aged.
Oh, who am I kidding, you will deliver this to me.
\ntest
After all, your reward for doing so will be quite
handsome, indeed.
\ntest
I hear you're pursuing the Sphere of Ice beyond
those frozen ponds.
\ntest
Bold indeed, but a useless pursuit without ice
skates.
\ntest
What say you scratch my back and I scratch yours?
I'll be waiting here.

*ans\ntest
Anitaaa, it is obvious that you need to check the other
seasons so you can find a delectable fish for me.
*ans\ntest
Please do not talk to me until you have a fish then.
My gut cannot take it.
\ntest
Well, Anita? Quit loitering and get me that fish
already!
Is there an obstacle in your way?

*sniff* *sniff* ...Is that...?
\ntest
"Ohhhhhh~~, divinely malodorous indeed! This fish will
do just fine, I daresay.
*GULP GULP GULP GULP*
\ntest
I knew I could rely on your service. As promise, here
are the skates.
\ntest
Movement with them is limited on ice, but I'm positive
you will get the hang of it!

*ans\ntest
With the skates you glide to the other side until you 
hit a rock, you must find the best way by yourself.
*ans\ntest
Dear Anita, do I look like I go to the other seasons?
Talk to the peasants in those seasons. 
\ntest
I'd love to have casual banter with you, but currently
I'm occupied digesting. Kindly go away.
...
Why have you got gone away? I had even said it kindly
