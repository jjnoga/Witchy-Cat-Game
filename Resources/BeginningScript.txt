I guess I should look around here in Spring first 
before I head out.

Summer has the burning flower, a good place to start
exploring the area.

The golden leaf should be in Fall, hopefully the
weather is nice and there are leaves on the ground.

I better get ready for the cold in Winter. I wonder
if there will be any new friends there.

Come on Anita, I can't believe you forgot to restock
the ingredients.
\ntest
Welp, I guess I will have to journey out and collect 
them. I only need to get 3 specific ingredients.

A perfect sphere of ice that never warms or melts
from the Winter area,
\ntest
a golden leaf from the biggest and oldest tree in
the Fall area,
\ntest
and a rare flower that burns with red fire but is
cool to the touch in the Summer area.
