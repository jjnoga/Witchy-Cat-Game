Well I don't know anything! That house is definitely,
100%, totally, empty and has nothing useful for sure.
*ans\ntest
Good! Cause I know nothing useful, now go away! I'm 
sulking over the fact that you're leaving me again.
\ntest
Heyy! Its Anita!!! It has been awhile since you've 
been to Fall.
Have you come to visit your's truly?
\ntest
I knew you would come crawling back to me someday!
No one can forget a relationship with Bruce the catch!
...
\ntest
Wait, what do you mean you aren't here to get back
together? What else would you be here for?
\ntest
Oh! I know! You're here for a night with me. While it
isn't night time, I am ready! Be ready for Bruce the f-
...
\ntest
O-oh, okay. First of all ouch, that hurt way more than
I thought it would.
Second of all, that was very rude and hurt my feelings.
\ntest
Third of all, there's literally no other reason you
would be here if not for a "meet up" or a date. 
(I would be doing finger quotes if I could)
...
\ntest
A potion ingredient? Really? That's it? That's so stu-
Wait no more scratching!!!!
\ntest
Okay okay, I assumed, my bad. You know where that
the leaves are in that sca- 
I mean, normal house's yard. 
\ntest
I don't know anything else! Now leave me be, I've got 
to nurse my wounds and my pride.

Are you stumped? You must be if you are back here

*ans\ntest
That sucks for you, cause I'm not gonna tell you about 
a store in Spring has an item that cuts the vines.
*ans\ntest
Why are you back here then??? Are you having fun 
torturing me?? Stop bugging me!
For God's sake, what do you want? Do you need help?
